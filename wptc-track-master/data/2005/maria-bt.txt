	Maria was briefly a major hurricane, but it remained well out at sea.




	Synoptic History

On 27 August, the axis of a large and strong tropical wave crossed the coast of Africa and moved into the far eastern tropical Atlantic. Cloudiness and showers associated with the wave soon became organized and by 28 August two areas of concentrated deep convection, each showing signs of circulation, were evident within the wave.  One of the areas moved northwestward to a location just west of the Cape Verde Islands, and subsequently became disorganized.  The other area, which was broader, moved westward for a day or so and then turned northwestward.  This system developed a well-defined low-level circulation on 31 August.  However, an adjacent upper-tropospheric cyclone produced strong south-southwesterly shear that prevented the formation of persistent deep convection near or over the center.  By 1200 UTC 1 September, convection became persistent enough near the center to designate that a tropical depression had formed about 910 n mi east of the northernmost Leeward Islands.  The “best track” chart of the tropical cyclone’s path is given in Fig. 1, with the wind and pressure histories shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.  The best track positions and intensities are listed in Table 1.

	A cell of the subtropical ridge was situated to the northeast of the tropical cyclone.  This was the primary steering feature, and it drove the system on a west-northwestward to northwestward track for several days.  The nearby upper-level low continued to exert a shearing influence, and this hindered significant intensification for about a day.  As the effects of the upper-level low lessened, the depression was able to strengthen into a tropical storm by around 1200 UTC 2 September.  However, the environment was still not very conducive for strengthening, and the storm intensified at a rather slow pace for a couple of days.  While continuing to move well out at sea around the western periphery of the subtropical high, Maria eventually became a hurricane at about 0600 UTC 4 September.  Upper-level winds became more favorable for strengthening on 4-5 September.  Maria developed a well-defined eye on 5 September and reached its peak intensity, estimated to be near 100 kt, around 0000 UTC 6 September.  The hurricane was centered about 415 n mi east of Bermuda at this time and had begun its recurvature around the subtropical anticyclone.  It has often been observed that Atlantic tropical cyclones reach their peak intensity around the time of recurvature.  

Maria was a major hurricane very briefly; in fact, a weakening trend was already underway at 0600 UTC 6 September.  The hurricane turned toward the northeast that day and there was a gradual increase in forward speed over the next couple of days, due to deep-layer southwesterly flow on the northwest side of the subtropical high.  The slow weakening trend was halted on UTC 7 September, when Maria appeared to combine with an upper-level trough and re-intensified slightly to about 75 kt.  By 8 September, slow weakening was again underway, and the cyclone diminished to tropical storm strength by about 0000 UTC 9 September.  Although Maria stubbornly hung on to tropical characteristics as it moved into the mid-latitudes, it was eventually transformed into an extratropical storm around 1200 UTC 10 September while accelerating north-northeastward.  In response to strong baroclinic forcing, the storm intensified and acquired hurricane-force winds over the north Atlantic on 11 September.  It began weakening again on 12 September and passed near Iceland on 13 September.  Finally, as the system approached Norway, it merged with another strong extratropical cyclone.  

	Meteorological Statistics

	Observations in Maria (Figs. 2 and 3) include satellite-based Dvorak technique intensity estimates from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB) and the U. S. Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).  Microwave satellite imagery from NOAA polar-orbiting satellites, the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the NASA QuikSCAT, and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites were also useful in tracking Maria.  QuikSCAT wind speed data were particularly useful on 7 September and provided the main basis for designating Maria as a hurricane even though most Dvorak intensity estimates indicated that it had weakened to a tropical storm.

	Only three ship reports of winds of tropical storm force associated with Maria were received.  These are listed in Table 2.	
								
	Casualty and Damage Statistics
	
	There were no reports of damages or casualties during the tropical cyclone stages of Maria.  However, the post-Maria merger with another extratropical low was a powerful cyclone, and it triggered a landslide in Norway that killed one person.

	Forecast and Warning Critique

	Average official track errors (with the number of cases in parentheses) for Maria were 33 (34), 56 (32), 74 (30), 85 (28), 120 (24), 156 (20), and 218 (16) n mi for the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h forecasts, respectively.  These errors are lower than the average official track errors for the 10-yr period 1995-2004

 	Errors given for the 96 and 120 h periods are averages over the four-year period 2001-4.  of 42, 75, 107, 138, 202, 236, and 310 n mi, respectively. Table 3 shows a comparison of the mean track errors for selected numerical guidance with those of the official forecasts.  The GUNA consensus and Florida State University Superensemble (FSSE) had lower errors than the official forecast (OFCL) at most forecast times.  At 72 h and beyond, however, those two numerical techniques had significantly fewer cases than the official (i.e., were frequently unavailable).  It should also be noted that the mean official error was slightly higher than CLP5 (Five-day Climatology and Persistence) at 120 h -- indicating no skill, on average, for the official forecasts at five days.

	Average official intensity errors were 6, 6, 8, 8, 12, 13, and 9 kt for the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h forecasts, respectively.  For comparison, the average official intensity errors over the 10-yr period 1995-2004 are 6, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, and 22 kt, respectively.  The official intensity forecasts were substantially better than average at two through five days.  A number of official forecasts were premature (as much as 48-54 h too early) in predicting Maria’s extratropical transition.

	For as long as four days in advance of its formation, the National Hurricane Center’s Tropical Weather Outlooks anticipated the formation of a tropical depression from the wave that eventually spawned Maria.  However, these outlooks first focused on the disturbed weather area that moved northwestward toward the Cape Verde Islands and failed to develop.  By 29 August, the Outlooks correctly began to identify a second, larger area of weather within the wave as a candidate for tropical cyclone formation.

	Watches and/or warnings were not required for any land areas.
