The Ramachandran printer plot code was derived from fisipl created by Frances 
C. Bernstein. See the Protein Data Bank program tape.

The CIF modifications make use of a library based in part on CBFlib by Paul 
J. Ellis and Herbert J. Bernstein.
See: http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/CBF

Parts of CBFlib is loosely based on the CIFPARSE software package from 
the NDB at Rutgers university.
