          Molecular Graphics Visualisation Software
                Version 2.2 - June 11, 2007

RasMol is a molecular graphics program intended for the visualisation 
of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. The program is aimed 
at display, teaching and generation of publication quality images.

RasMol was initially developped by Roger Sayle. Special thanks to 
Roger for creating RasMol and giving its source code to the community.
Read the file version to learn about the history of the different 
releases prior to this package. RasMol is open-source thanks to the 
work of Herbert J. Bernstein. Please read the notice and the license

RasTop is a graphical user interface to RasMol aimed at the quick 
visualization and analysis of macromolecules. RasTop was initially 
developped by Philippe Valadon. Please direct comments and bug report
to RasTop home page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/rastop/.
