IUCr Policy

The IUCr Policy on the Use of the Crystallographic Information File (CIF)

The Crystallographic Information File (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is, 
as of January 1992, the recommended method for submitting publications 
to Acta Crystallographica Section C. The International Union of 
Crystallography holds the Copyright on the CIF, and has applied for 
Patents on the STAR File syntax which is the basis for the CIF format.

It is a principal objective of the IUCr to promote the use of CIF for 
the exchange and storage of scientific data. The IUCr's sponsorship of 
the CIF development was motivated by its responsibility to its scientific 
journals, which set the standards in crystallographic publishing. The 
IUCr intends that CIFs will be used increasingly for electronic submission 
of manuscripts to these journals in future. The IUCr recognises that, 
if the CIF and the STAR File are to be adopted as a means for universal 
data exchange, the syntax of these files must be strictly and uniformly 
adhered to. Even small deviations from the syntax would ultimately cause 
the demise of the universal file concept. Through its Copyrights and 
Patents the IUCr has taken the steps needed to ensure strict conformance 
with this syntax.

The IUCr policy on the use of the CIF and STAR File processes is as follows:

1. CIFs and STAR Files may be generated, stored or transmitted, without 
permission or charge, provided their purpose is not specifically for 
profit or commercial gain, and provided that the published syntax is 
strictly adhered to.

2. Computer software may be developed for use with CIFs or STAR files, 
without permission or charge, provided it is distributed in the public 
domain. This condition also applies to software for which a charge is 
made, provided that its primary function is for use with files that 
satisfy condition 1 and that it is distributed as a minor component of 
a larger package of software.

3. Permission will be granted for the use of CIFs and STAR Files for 
specific commercial purposes (such as databases or network exchange 
processes), and for the distribution of commercial CIF/STAR software, 
on written application to the IUCr Executive Secretary, 2 Abbey Square, 
Chester CH1 2HU, England. The nature, terms and duration of the licenses 
granted will be determined by the IUCr Executive and Finance Committees.

In summary, the IUCr wishes to promote the use of the STAR File concepts 
as a standard universal data file. It will insist on strict compliance 
with the published syntax for all applications. To assist with this 
compliance, the IUCr provides public domain software for checking the 
logical integrity of a CIF, and for validating the data name definitions 
contained within a CIF. Detailed information on this software, and the 
associated dictionaries, may be obtained from the IUCr Office at 5 Abbey 
Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England.
