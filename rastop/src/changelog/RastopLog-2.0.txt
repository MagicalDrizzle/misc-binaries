[23/02/00]      HJB     infile.c
                Fix *- for - typo in XYZ and MOL2 input of coordinates


[05/01] PV

	- Clipping is not resetted anymore upon "reset" in order to respect 
	  the world construction when new molecules are loaded. The old way
	  of bringing clips to the center of the molecule does not seem
	  logical.

	- Added command "reset ligth", "reset slab", and "reset depth".
	- Cmndline.c: Added function ProcessWheelDial(). 

	- ResizeScreen: Corrected background redrawing in Displaymode.
	- DefineColourMap: Darkened DisplayMode Background.
    - Added variable SRange and fixed stereo mode.
	- Finished code for slab and back-clipping (all files). Added code
	  for commands "slab world <number>" and "slab world origin",
	  and equivalent for depth mode.
	- Finished code for manipulation of rotation centers; made
      center visible in display mode; added centre command syntax
      from rasmol 2.7.2.1. 
	- Added commands:
	  "centre world": Translate world origin to centre of screen, world
	  is translated at the same time;
	  "centre origin": Bring center to world origin
	  "centre origin centre": Translate world origin to actual rotation
	  center; this is a "world" destructive command!

[04/01] PV
	- Added new panes to status bar.
	- command.c: errorcount versus rastop 1.3.1, corrected bug in
	  executecommand.
	- Corrected ExecuteTitleCommand() and SetTitle() for new titles.
	- Changed edit menu; put accelerator key to "enter rasmol command".
	- Modified command panel, added world button.
	- Modified DisplayMode.
	- Added commands "molecule hide" and "molecule show" (see
	  comdline and pickatoms + all molset->visible references).
	- DisplayRibbons(): Corrected alignement of DNA helix.

[03/01] PV

	- Added fast drawing (variable FastDraw).
	- Added variable DrawWorldAxes.

	- Added zoom to comndline.c in rotate all mode; Corrected a few
	  bugs in ProcessMouseMove().
	- Introduced molecule offsets MOffset[] to position molecules during
	  all transformations; X/Y/ZOffset are equivalent integers used 
	  for calculating rendering.
	- Changed DialValue for translation to modulo[2] (free translation).


[01/01] PV

	- Added code for preferences.
	- Added code for default script in default representation.

	- rasview.cpp rasdoc.cpp
	  Corrected Windows 2000 bug.

	- Passed conditions on RegisterAlloc() into the function.

	- Added bond rotation code, renamed wbrotate.c brotate.c (all the
	  world-rotate code is tranfered into transfor.c).
	  Added ChangeBondOrder(), removed NewBond, removed RotBond mode, and
	  added PickRBond picking mode.
	  Added command "bond <number> <number> single/double/triple/unbound".
	  Added command "set picking bond rotate" and "set picking rotate bond".
	  Removed function RemoveBond(); Attempted to correct erroneous hbond
	  and ssbond in BondRotate() by simply destroying bond lists!

	- Added code for picking lightsource in picking mode.
	- Added PickLight mode;  
	- Added F1 help.

	  Put "strcpy(Info.filename,DataFileName);" uniquely in ProcessFile()
	  with correction for "inline" files in DivertoData().
	
	- Transfered new 2.7.2 FetchFile function to ProcessFile()

	- Confusion on attribution of DataFileFormat. Only attribution in 
	  processfile() is conserved.

	- DrawFrameOne() transfor.h
	  Replaced ApplyTransform() by ApplyTransformOne().

[11/00] PV 

	- multiple.c command.c
	Transfered ZapDatabase() into multiple.c; changed name to Zapmolecule();
	created new Zapdatabase() for zapping all molecules. Added command
	"zap molecule", "zap selected" and "zap all" with "zap" synonymous of

	Typing bug corrected.

	- transfor.c/.h wbrotate.c/.h

	Completed cartoons code.

	- rasview.cpp rasdoc.cpp mainframe.cpp pannel.h/.cpp
	Reorganized automode.
