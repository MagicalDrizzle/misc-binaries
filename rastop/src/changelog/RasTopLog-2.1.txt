This log contains changes made to rastop from version 2.0 to 2.1

[09/04] PV
	- Reported by Katsuhiro NAGATOMO, some saved scripts (rsm) are too long to
	  load. The root of this problem seems to hold in an excessive use of
	  ForEachAtom to manipulate selected atoms. No simple implementation at this
	  point to correct the problem.

[05/04] PV
	- multiple.c: Added SideLen and Offset to VarList.
	- infile.c: UpdateFeature() Corrected bug responsible for incorrect drawing of
	  ribbons in protein models. Thanks to Shuji Tomoda for reporting the bug.
	- command.c, transfor.c: Added jmol command spacefill -<value> to specify
	  radii in percentage of CPK values.
	- transfor.c: Put 0.60 factor for LastSpecShade calculation.	  

[04/04] PV
	- infile.c:ProcessPDBBond() Hacked to allow multiple bonds through CONECT
	  record to be drawn, but will work only for consecutive identical CONECT
	  record. This facility disapeared in the rasmol 2.7 series, thanks
	  to Malcolm Stephen for reporting the problem.
	- outfile.c: added routine WriteBMP32File() to save bmp file in 32-bits on
	  windows platform.
	- command.c:ProcessFile(): Corrected bug with connectivity of xyz files
	  (Info.bondcount < (MainAtomCount+HetaAtomCount)-Info.chaincount is wrongly
	  calculated because chaincount equals MainAtomCount in this case. See
	  correction. Thanks to Filipe Tiago de Oliveira for reporting the problem.
	- Added menu option to disable automatic running of default Representation
	  script file upon file loading.

[03/04] PV
	- see command.c: attempted to implement the new translate command. The 
	  possible mixing of absolute and relative units makes it very confusing.
	  We will not deprecate <position> this time!
	- transfor.c,repres.c/.h: modified restrict command to include Monitors,
	  dot surface, SS bonds, and H-bonds.
    - Modified reset command: the world scenery is zoomed to fit exactly the
	  screen with commands "reset world" or "reset" with world on; see ResetAxes()
	  and getWorldRadius90;
	- got stupid bug in ZapDatabase() that prevented ReRadius() on closing,
	  sometimes resulting in molecules not opening at the correct size.

[02/04] PV
    - Modified zooming effect on scrolling bars from command panel;
	- Added command <set language default>

[01/04] PV
	- Added loading of preferences file located in lib folder;
	- Added Scripting bar;
	- Modified Preferences to save all window states.


[10/03] PV
	- cmndline.c: Modifid MouseMapping MouseRasMol to allow zooming from center
	  of screen (pseudo world Z-translation) while pressing the two mouse cliks
	  in RasMol mapping.
	- tranfor.c: corrected function Round(), thanks to Audric Schiltknecht.
	- Change rounding to function Rint().
	- Corrected bug in InitInstance, thanks to Joachim Strub.


[01/03] PV

	- infile.c: Changed coordinate saving in all formats;
	- script.c: Fixed povray code.

[10/02] PV

	- command.c: rewrote save command;

Currents changes for built RasTop 2.0.2

[09/02] PV
	- pixutil.c: [UpdateAcross] corrected bug.
	- infile.c [SavePDBMolecule]: Changed saved coordinates to current coordinate
	  system - mod suggested by Andrew Horsfield.
	- multiple.c: Corrected bug (missing ElemDesc in VarList).
	- prefer.c: Changed rasmolprefs localisation to C:\Document and Settings\userdir\
	  \rasmolprefs.
	- Changed internal value of Shapower.
	- command.c: corected bug in rotate command.
	- Removed all direct calls in rasmol core from rastop gui.



Currents changes for built RasTop 2.0.1

[06/02] PV
	- render.c [TestAtomProximity]: Corrected bug on ptr - Thanks to Naoum Salem.

[05/02] PV
	- colorbar.cpp: changed order of background in ItemList. Suggested by
	  Naoum Salem.
	- selectbar.h: corrected carbon selection, error reported by Naoum Salem.
	- molecule.h: corrected of structure _HBonds col from byte to short; thanks
	  to Naoum Salem.
	- commande.c: Corrected error on "save molecule" command and error on
	  fclose, thanks to Naoum Salem.

[03/02] PV
	- rasdoc.cpp, rasview.cpp, rasgraphics.cpp: improved handling of zoom
	  factor for printing and copying to clipboard.
	- selecbar.h/,c: Added current selection to selection toolbar, suggestion
	  from Naoum Salame.
	- rasgraphics.cpp: Added a refresh in paste selection routine.
