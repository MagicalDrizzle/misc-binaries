--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Started version 1.3. The following modifications are attemps to improve rasmol
drawing.  The code probably needs some improvment.

[12/14/99] PV transform.c and others
		Added function CentreTransform() to either move the origin in the molecule
		or move the molecule to the origin (origin = True ).  Added variables
		Cenx,y,z, which mesure distance centre-origin. Changed DrawTwinVector to 
		ClipTwinVector in DisplayWireFrame() (render.c).

[12/14/99] PV 
		Added variables ShiftS and UseAutoDepthCue that adjust DepthCue 
		with slabbing. 

[12/17/99] PV render.c
		Added centre correction in DisplayBoxes().

[12/18/99] PV
		Added code for backclipping based on ZOffset.  New variable UseDepthPlane
		and DialValue[8].

[12/20/99] PV script.c
		Added more precision to rotate, translate, zoom, and slab commands in 
		WriteScriptFile() and WriteScriptPosition().  This is important 
		for passing cliboard content and saving centre.  Fixed centre scripting.

[01/03/00] PV transfor.c
		Fixed bug (and modified) function Power() to handle Specpower.

[01/14/00] PV molecule.c
		Set Info.filename as alternative title.

[01/16/00] PV transfor.h/.c token.h/.c script.c
		Added ShadePower in DefineColourMap(), which brings some interesting
		shade variations. Added ShadePowerTok and command "set shade x" with
		x between -20 to 20.

[01/16/00] PV cmndline.c PerformMouseFunc()
		Corrected MM_CLIP to access clipping with the mouse;
		Added MM_DEPT to access backclipping (depth) with the mouse.

[01/16/00] PV
		Completed 32-bits version.  Code a bit messy, especially for 
		clipboard and background operations.  Will probably not compile on
		other compilers.  bmp file saving not done in 32 bits.

		Added code for command "set dot <value>" which adjusts the size
		of the dots in a rather rough way.

[01/17/00] PV script.c
		Corrected bug in WriteScriptAtoms().

[01/17/00] PV render.c 
		Solved problem in regenerating background in 32 bits in ReSizeScreen().

[01/17/00] PV command.c ExecutePauseCommand()
		Added a RFRefresh for refreshing RasTop screen.

[01/28/00] PV render.c ResetRender()
		(Bug?) Finally found old problem with shadows in RasTop.  Missing 
		a ResetVoxelData() on zapping. This is a potential source of problems 
		when successively opening scripts containing shadows in Rasmol.

[01/30/00] PV command.c 
		Added command "select view" and corresponding code, which allows to 
		select part of a molecule based on screen display.

[01/31/00] PV command.c
		Added code for selecting atom areas with mouse:
		- change PickAtom() function name in PickAtoms();
		- change PicAtome identifier in PickAtom;
		- added function SelectArea() and DisplayArea();
		- added code for command "select view";

[02/02/00] PV pixutil.c render.c
		Added function ClipDashLine();
		Changed display of cells with dashed lines in DisplayBoxes().


[08/27/00]	PV
		Release RasTop1.3
