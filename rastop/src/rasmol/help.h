 *   * 2. Please give credit where credit is due citing the version and    *

 * If you would like to use major pieces of RasMol in some other program,  *
 * make modifications to RasMol, or in some other way make what a lawyer   *
 * would call a "derived work", you are not only permitted to do so, you   *
 * are encouraged to do so. In addition to the things we discussed above,  *

 * This version of RasMol is not in the public domain, but it is given     *

 * changes, please make them in a responsible manner, and please offer us  *
 * the opportunity to include those changes in future versions of RasMol.  *
